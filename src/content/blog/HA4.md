### I. Introduction

For international students nearing the end of high school: Should they pursue a college degree or jump straight into a career? This decision is pivotal for personal development and has substantial financial implications. Understanding the potential salary differences between these two paths can significantly influence their choices and future careers. This article intends to provide a comprehensive salary comparison over five years for international students contemplating the high school to career route versus pursuing a college degree.

### II. High School to Career Path

#### A. Common Career Options for High School Graduates

International students who enter the workforce right after high school often find opportunities in various fields.

- **Trade Jobs:** Skilled trades such as electricians, plumbers, and carpenters are in high demand. These roles often require vocational training, which is less time-consuming and costly compared to a four-year college degree.
- **Service Industry Roles:** Jobs in hospitality, retail, and customer service sectors are popular among high school graduates. These positions can provide stability and are often abundant, particularly in urban areas.
- **Tech Support and Entry-Level Positions:** Many businesses look for individuals to fill tech support or administrative roles, which typically require minimal experience but offer a stepping stone to higher positions.

#### B. Financial Considerations

- **Initial Earning Potential and Job Stability:** Many trades and service roles offer competitive starting salaries. With experience, these positions can lead to job security as skilled labour becomes increasingly indispensable.
- **Cost of Entry:** Getting into a trade might involve certification costs, but these are generally lower compared to college tuition. According to studies, vocational training can save students thousands, allowing them to start earning quickly.
- **Long-Term Financial Growth Opportunities:**  Skilled workers often have the chance to advance quickly, sometimes surpassing the earnings of those with college degrees in the same field.

#### C. Job Market Trends and Opportunities

- **Demand for Skilled Labor vs. Degree Holders:** Many sectors prioritize skills and hands-on experience over formal education, with skilled trades experiencing significant shortages in several regions.
- **Regional Job Availability Variations:** Job markets vary greatly by location. While urban areas may have more opportunities in retail and service industries, rural areas often have a stronger demand for skilled trades.
- **Impact of Technology on Job Roles:** As tech advances, skilled labour roles are evolving, increasing the need for workers who can adapt and learn new skills.

### III. College Degree Path

#### A. Degree Options and Their Relevance

- **Popular Fields of Study for International Students:** International students often pursue degrees in fields like business, engineering, healthcare, and computer science. These areas typically promise higher salaries post-graduation.
- **Degree Levels and Career Impact:** Students need to understand that the type of degree can significantly affect career prospects. An associate degree might lead to entry-level positions, while a bachelor's or higher degree often opens doors to management roles.
- **Importance of Internships and Practical Experience:** : Gaining experience through internships can be invaluable. Many employers look for practical skills alongside academic achievement, making internships an important consideration.

#### B. Financial Implications of Pursuing a Degree

- **Tuition Costs and Student Loans:** College can be a financial burden, with tuition costs rising each year. Many students rely on loans, which can impact their finances significantly post-graduation.
- **Long-Term Financial Benefits of Higher Education:** Pursuing a degree can be a valuable investment in future financial security. While the upfront costs may be significant, graduates often experience higher earning potential, better career opportunities, and increased job stability, making the initial investment in education a rewarding choice in the long run.
- **Education and Salary Growth Correlation:** Generally, higher education is associated with greater salary growth over time, as many professions require advanced degrees for advancement.

#### C. Marketability and Long-Term Career Prospects

- **Networking and Alumni Connections:** : The college provides a unique opportunity to build a network. Alumni connections can prove crucial in securing internships and job placements.
- **Employer Preferences for Degrees vs. Experience:** : While many employers favour degrees, there's an increasing recognition of experience. Finding the right balance is essential.
- **Projected Growth in Key Fields:** Fields like technology, healthcare, and finance are consistently projected to grow, suggesting long-term job security for graduates in these areas.

### IV. Salary Comparison Over Five Years
 
#### A. Analyzing Salary Data

- **Starting Salaries for High School Graduates vs. Degree Holders:** On average, high school graduates may start at around \$30,000 to \$40,000, while degree holders can expect starting salaries between \$50,000 and \$64,000, depending on the field.
- **Salary Growth Trajectories:** Degree holders often start with higher salaries and experience faster growth over five years compared to high school graduates.
- **Benefits and Bonuses:** Degree holders often receive better benefits and bonuses, which can add considerable value beyond just base salary.

#### B. Case Studies and Real-Life Examples

- **Success Stories of High School Graduates:** Many high school graduates have built successful careers in trades, earning upwards of $50,000 in their late twenties through skilled labor roles.

- **Profiles of College Graduates and Their Earnings:** College graduates in bachelor's degree fields frequently report starting salaries between \$50,000 to \$64,000, and master's or higher degree salaries start from \$60,900 to \$84,000 which can rise dramatically with experience.
- **Comparisons of Salary by Field and Location:** Salaries can vary based on geographic location; for example, tech jobs in Silicon Valley typically offer more compared to similar roles in less urban areas.

#### C. The Impact of Additional Factors
	
- **Influence of Location on Salary Outcomes:** Geographic regions can sway salary averages significantly, with metropolitan areas offering higher pay in most industries.
- **Importance of Skills and Experience in Salary Negotiations:** Skills, certifications, and internships can play a crucial role in salary negotiations, even for fresh graduates.

#### Chart Description
This line chart illustrates the salary progression of high school graduates compared to college graduates over five years. The chart uses two data to represent the average starting salaries of each group:

- High School Graduates: Represented by the blue line, starting at \$30,000 in Year 1 and gradually increasing to \$40,000 by Year 5. This reflects a typical salary trajectory for high school graduates who may enter the workforce directly after graduation, often in entry-level positions.

- College Graduates: Shown by the green line, starting at \$60,000 in Year 1 and increasing to \$72,000 by Year 5. This trend demonstrates the higher earning potential of college graduates, particularly in fields such as technology and healthcare, which often offer substantial starting salaries.

The data emphasizes the significant difference in earning potential between the two groups, underlining the financial benefits of pursuing higher education. The consistent salary growth for both groups highlights the potential for advancement over time, but the gap remains considerable, illustrating the long-term value of a college degree.
